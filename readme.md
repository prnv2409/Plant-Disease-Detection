# How to Use:
 
Soon Website will be Deployed 

## What will be in the website
* Home Page Containing Picture Uploading option and test by Link.
* Fast Prediction
* Cure Suggestions
* Information about Disease 

## How it is going to help :
<hr>
As we know many farmers crops got destroyed due to disease in crops. I have my own story when there is a bacterial disease came in cotton plants. That turns every farmer of my village into hell of debt.

## So In many ways this project is going to help each and every farmer.
